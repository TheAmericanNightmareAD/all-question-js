//Ternary Operator-Conditionals
//The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.

//Syntax : True / False ? :

let ageofvote=25;
ageofvote>=18?console.log("you can vote"):console.log("You Can't Vote");
